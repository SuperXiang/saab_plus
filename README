# Structural Annotation of BCR Receptor Repertoires
SAAB+: annotation of BCR Receptor Repertoires with structural information, using separate tools
to map non-CDR-H3 and CDR-H3 loop sequence to repersentative structures.

## Getting Started
Please follow instructions below to install SAAB+ pipeline on our machine

### Prerequisites
SAAB+ comes with **FREAD** package, however, **anarci** and **scallop** are not supplied.


INSTRUCTION to run SAAB+



Input file:
	fasta file

Running the pipeline:
	struct_filtering.py - running anarci parsing to filter out 
			      structurally flawed antibody sequences
